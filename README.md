# C++ Module 03: Inheritance

This is a 42 school project. This module focuses on inheritance and derived classes in C++.

Concepts learned and applied:
- Exercise 00: Aaaaand... OPEN!
  - Coding and simulating basic game objects such as health, attack, and repair
- Exercise 01: Serena, my love!
  - Class inheritance and behavior of derived classes
  - Order of construction and destruction for derived classes
  - Using base class pointers and references to refer to derived class
  - Virtual functions and override keyword
- Exercise 02: Repetitive work
  - Deepening understanding of polymorphism by making other derived classes from the same base class
  - Practice making more derived classes with different features, and following DRY principle
- Exercise 03: Now itâ€™s weird!
  - Multiple inheritance and diamond shaped inheritance pattern
  - The application, issues, and risks of using multiple inheritance
  - Virtual base classes and resolving the diamond problem
  - Overriding and overloading functionality in derived classes
